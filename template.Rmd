I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Section 3
### Data frame and plot
the code chunk below creates a data frome and generates a plot

```{r plot example, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
plot_df=tibble(
  x=rnorm(500, mean=2,sd=4),
  y=3-4.2*x+rnorm(500)
)
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x,y = y)) + geom_point()
```

This plot is great!

The data frame has `r nrow(plot_df)` rows

Here is a list:

* This is my first list item
* lists need at least two items
  * This list has a sub item
* Third list item
